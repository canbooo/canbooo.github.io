Executive summary of my life in greentext style:

- Be me, be born in Istanbul, Turkey
- Use Matlab to help engineer father conduct multibody simulations in high-school
- Graduate to Deutsche Schule
- Study mechanical engineering at RWTH Aachen
- Optimize designs and simulation model parameters to graduate
- Require many calculations but no workflows available
- Learn python to automate conducting simulations
- Simulations take too long
- Use polynomial regression to learn simulations
- Polynomial regression is too inaccurate
- Discover <a href="http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf">Gaussian processes</a>, fall in love
- Enroll to PhD
- Discover active learning and Bayesian optimization to do big things with small data, impress engineers
- Research about using active learning to accelerate design uncertainty quantification an optimization
- Meanwhile, discover <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">deep learning</a> (DL), fall in love again
- It's 2017-ish, no one in the engineering industry has enough data for DL to be useful
- Spend sleepless nights messing around with various public data sets to learn more about DL
- Hear about AlphaGo and AlphaStar beating humans
- Dive into reinforcement learning (RL), fall in love yet again
- Spend sleepless nights discovering RL, start with <a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">spinning-up</a>, move on to <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html">big boy books</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Marco-Wiering/dp/364227644X">beyond</a>
- Get a job at a university spin-off, PhD still not done
- Work with industry giants, finally get to use knowledge about DL and RL
- Mentor new people in university, hold lectures on machine learning
- PhD still not finished, underpaid and overworked as hell
- Go bananas, finish PhD
- Get corporate job, fix salary problem

Fast-forward today, I am trying to get used to having finished my PhD and preparing to give back more to the community, as I am thankful to the community for letting me find my true passion, teaching machines and sometimes also humans.
