As a scientist driven by passion and a pragmatist dedicated to real-world applications, I immerse myself in the realms of machine learning research and applied probability theory. During my PhD journey, I specialized in customizing machine learning for small datasets and deploying active learning to expedite uncertainty quantification and optimization.

My commitment to education and collaboration led me to the joy of mentoring PhD students. Having recently earned my PhD, I've embraced a role as an applied scientist at Zalando, where I focus on advancing probabilistic delivery time estimation.

Continuing my active pursuit of knowledge, I engage in ongoing research across diverse domains. My dedication to mentoring PhD students not only contributes to their growth but also fuels my ability to publish papers, fostering a dynamic academic exchange. (Edited by ChatGPT)


Besides research and mentoring, I like
- Learning new things
- Tackling problems without an apparent solution
- Good visualizations
- Curious people
- Beer
