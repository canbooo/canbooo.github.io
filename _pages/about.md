I am a scientist at heart and a pragmatist at work.
I am enthusiastic about machine learning research and applied probability theory.
I researched machine learning methods for small data and how to accelerate uncertainty quantification and optimization using active learning during my PhD.
I worked and lectured for a while and found my passion for mentoring PhD students.
I have a secret crush on reinforcement learning due to some projects at my previous job, where we trained agents to solve problems, which seemed too difficult to humans.
Recently, I finished my PhD and started a position at <a href="www.zalando.de">Zalando</a> as applied scientist to work on probabilistic delivery time estimation.

Besides research and mentoring, I like
- Learning new things
- Tackling problems without an apparent solution
- Good visualizations
- Curious people
- Beer
