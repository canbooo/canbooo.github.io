I started using Matlab at high-school to assist my father conduct multibody physics simulations. 
Being the son of an academic, I have wanted to pursue a PhD since those days. 
Perhaps because of this experience, or maybe his passion for designing machines, I followed the footsteps of my father and studied mechanical engineering at RWTH Aachen, one of the best universities in Germany for this topic.

Along the way, my interest shifted from mechanical machinery to digital ones. Specifically, I wanted to optimize designs, but the simulations were taking too long. 
To tackle this problem, I used polynomial regression to accelerate the process. However, polynomial models were often too inaccurate to achieve meaningful results. 
That is when I first met Gaussian processes and the term machine learning for metamodeling. My mind was blown. I immediately enrolled into a PhD program to learn more about learning machines. 
I learnt the book <a href="http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf">Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</a> (Carl Edward Rassmussen) by heart.
 Back then (2015), machine learning was on the rise (again), and after reading the <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">deep learning</a> book (Ian Goodfellow), I fell in love with neural networks.

Fast-forward a few years, towards the end of my PhD, I heard about AlphaGo beating the highest ranked Go-Masters in the world. 
Growing up, a few mathematicians that I knew told me that it is nearly impossible to write a bot that could beat a mediocre human. My mind was blown, againâ€¦ And one more time, when AlphaStar has beaten humans at StarCraft II. 
I immediately started learning more about reinforcement learning. There were many good resources along the way, 
but the <a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">spinning-up</a> from OpenAI allowed me to get into this topic fast, and start training my own agents that could beat my high-score in Atari games. 
It helped that I was assigned as a consultant to a project regarding reinforcement learning by my PhD advisor, and a second one by the first company I worked for.

Now, keeping the fire to learn more about machine learning alive, I feel it is time for me to give back to the community, and hopefully blow the minds of young padawans, as mine was blown by pioneering giants. 
Nevertheless, it is important to generate value using the acquired knowledge. Everything else would be just selfish.
